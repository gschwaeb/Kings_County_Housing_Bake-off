# Kings County Housing Bake-off
### Author: Gary Schwaeber
The goal of this project is explore housing data from Kings County, WA and to use the data to build a model to predict housing prices.

The Kings_County_Housing_Bake-off.ipynb file contains the exploratory data analysis on the Kings County housing data, feature engineering, model building, and the final model.

The Predict_Holdout.ipynb file contains the application of the same cleaning techniques and feature engineering on the holdout dataset and ultimately predictions applied by the final model.

The data folder contains the training data set, prediction data set, census data for getting zipcode information, a pickle file containing the final model, and a pickle file containg other information used to clean the holdout data and apply the model.
